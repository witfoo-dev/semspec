// reviewExecution holds in-memory state for a single review workflow execution.
// It is keyed by entityID (semspec.workflow.<review-type>.<slug>) in the
// component's activeReviews sync.Map. This avoids round-trip reads of the
// entity triple store when routing loop-completion events back to the correct
// dispatch handler.
//
// All field access must be guarded by mu. The sync.Map in Component protects
// the map operations (Load/Store/Delete), but the struct itself is shared
// across goroutines (trigger handler, completion handler, timeout callback).
