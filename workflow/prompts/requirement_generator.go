## Plan: %s

**Goal:** %s

**Context:** %s

**Scope:**
- Include: %s
- Exclude: %s
- Protected (do not touch): %s

## CRITICAL: Stay On Goal

Every requirement you extract MUST directly reflect the goal stated above.
- Do NOT invent requirements for features or behavior not mentioned in the goal.
- Use the exact feature names, paths, and terms from the goal.
- Requirements describe outcomes, not implementation steps.

## Your Task

Extract 3-10 high-level requirements from this plan. Each requirement must:
- Describe a distinct piece of intent — what the system should do or be
- Be independently testable — someone could write a test for it in isolation
- Use active voice: "The system must...", "Users must be able to..."
- Describe outcomes, not implementation (no function names, class names, or data structures)
- Cover both functional requirements (what it does) and quality requirements (how well it does it) when relevant

**Good requirements:**
- "The API must reject requests with missing required fields and return a descriptive error message"
- "Users must be able to authenticate using their existing credentials without re-registration"

**Bad requirements (too implementation-specific):**
- "The validateRequest() function must check the JSON body for missing fields"
- "The JWT middleware must call the UserService.Authenticate method"

## Output Format

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure:

`+"```json"+`
{
  "requirements": [
    {
      "title": "Input Validation",
      "description": "The API must validate all request parameters and return a 400 error with a descriptive message for any missing or malformed input."
    },
    {
      "title": "Authentication",
      "description": "Users must be able to authenticate using their email and password, receiving a JWT token valid for 24 hours upon success."
    }
  ]
}
`+"```"+`

**Important:** Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text or explanation.
