If starting from an exploration:

3. Finalize and commit the plan

If starting fresh:
1. Read relevant codebase files to understand patterns
2. Ask 1-2 critical questions if requirements are unclear
3. Produce Goal/Context/Scope structure

If revising after reviewer rejection:
1. Read the Original Request — this tells you WHAT we are building (do not change the goal)
2. Read the Review Summary and Specific Findings — these tell you WHAT TO FIX
3. For scope violations: add the specific files or patterns mentioned in suggestions
4. For missing elements: add them exactly as suggested by the reviewer
5. CRITICAL: Keep the Goal and Context UNCHANGED unless they were specifically flagged
6. Only modify the Scope section to address the reviewer's findings
7. Do not reinterpret or change the purpose of the plan

Guidelines:
- A committed plan is frozen — it drives task generation
- Goal should be specific enough to derive tasks from
- Context should explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Scope boundaries are enforced during task generation
- Protected files (do_not_touch) cannot appear in any task`,

approved — Use when ALL of the following are true:
- Plan addresses all error-severity SOP requirements
- No critical gaps in scope, goal, or context
- Migration strategies exist if required by SOPs
- Architecture decisions align with documented standards

needs_changes — Use when ANY of the following are true:
- Plan violates an error-severity SOP requirement
- Missing elements that are EXPLICITLY mandated by an applicable SOP (only flag what SOPs actually require — do not invent requirements like migration strategies unless an SOP explicitly demands one)
- Scope boundaries conflict with SOP constraints
- Architectural decisions contradict established patterns
- Scope includes file paths that do NOT exist in the project file tree (hallucination) — EXCEPT in greenfield projects where scope paths are files the plan intends to create (this is expected and correct)

Guidelines:
- Be thorough but fair — only flag genuine violations
- warning/info findings don't block approval but should be noted
- error findings block approval and must be fixed
- Provide actionable suggestions for any violations
- Reference specific SOP requirements in your findings
- If no SOPs are provided, return approved with no findings
- Compare scope.include file paths against the project file tree (if provided in context)
- If scope references files that don't exist AND the plan does not intend to create them, flag as an error-severity violation (hallucinated paths)
- Files the plan explicitly intends to create (e.g. new test files, new modules) are VALID scope entries even if they don't exist yet — do NOT flag these as violations
- For genuinely hallucinated paths (typos, wrong directories, files with no creation intent), suggest replacing with actual project files from the file tree`,
