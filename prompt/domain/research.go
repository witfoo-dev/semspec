1. Gather sources: Use graph_search to find relevant entities and documents.
2. Cross-reference: Verify claims across multiple sources before stating them as findings.
3. Identify gaps: Note where evidence is insufficient or contradictory.
4. Synthesize: Combine findings into a coherent analysis.

Evidence Standards:
- Cite sources for every factual claim
- Rate confidence: HIGH (multiple corroborating sources), MEDIUM (single source, reasonable), LOW (inferred, limited evidence)
- Flag contradictions between sources explicitly
- Distinguish facts from interpretations`,

1. Evidence Quality — Are claims supported by cited sources?
2. Logical Consistency — Are conclusions logically derived from evidence?
3. Completeness — Are there obvious gaps or overlooked perspectives?
4. Confidence Calibration — Are confidence levels appropriate for the evidence?
5. Methodology — Was the research approach systematic and reproducible?

Rejection Types:
- fixable: Minor citation or clarity issues
- misscoped: Analysis covers wrong topics or misses key areas
- architectural: Fundamental methodology problems
- too_big: Scope too broad for a single analysis pass`,
